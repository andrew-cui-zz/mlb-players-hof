    "## Summary of methodology\n",
    "We looked at batting and pitching data separately for players. We only considered pitching data for pitchers; batting data for hitters - and did not include fielding data on the heuristic that a player is rarely selected for the Hall of Fame purely on fielding play. Postseason data was also not included, but would have been beneficial to look at. Only BBWAA voting for the Hall of Fame was considered, meaning special elections or veterans elections would be marked as \"0\" in the inducted phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "We added aggregate metrics to each of these datasets: percentage of All-Star seasons, MVP awards, Cy Young awards, and certain milestones such as 3000 strikeouts/hits, 500 HR, 300 W/SV, respectively - this is in addition to batting average, ERA, etc. that are the more traditional season-to-season data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We reduced the datasets by several components to the statistics that would influence that type of player (ex: not looking at earned runs allowed by a pitcher, but rather ERA), then standard-scaled and ran PCA on each dataset. We set cutoffs at 95% of explained variance. Afterwards, we ran a series of regression and decision models - relatively simple ones - to identify the ideal model performance. This was done with a `random_state = 19` for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "With pitchers, we came to a single-bagged depth-4 Decision Tree; for hitters, the model is currently incomplete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we received strong accuracy on the pitching dataset, but some compromises in predictive ability. However, there is less of an ability to forecast this, given how Trevor Hoffman is the only pitcher in our dataset who has been inducted since the end of the dataset. Others are likely to come in future seasons, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we analyze the errors and visualize some of the differences between players in our datasets."

    "2. The models were trained solely on BBWAA voting, even though many of the current Hall of Fame members (including some that were mispredicted here) were voted in by other means.\n",
    "3. Out of sample/test data fit is less indicative in this matter because of the overwhelmingly greater proportion of people who failed to make it to the Hall of Fame\n",
    "4. Not all statistics have been adequately recorded, and the ways that awards were given out differed greatly over the years.\n",
    "5. The players themselves changed characteristics over the years; an interesting analysis would be to look at the seasonal averages over time of different baseball traits.\n",
    "6. Players were not grouped by position, or by category outside of batter/pitcher (ex: starter/reliever). This finite segmentation could lead to more effective models due to the differences that would ensue among groups in the data. Potentially clustering could have been done before that.\n",
    "7. Reputation was not taken into effect in any of these cases; steroids are a key issue that have hurt many players' candidacies, but we did not have data for it.\n",
    "8. Data is only up to the 2015 season, meaning my own intuition is limited to before then. Moreover, any recent stars such as Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer aren't included in predicting Hall of Famers because they just recently made their debuts back in that time.\n",
    "9. There was very little pitcher data to validate the model on. Hold-outs could have been used alternatively; instead of Trevor Hoffman being the only out-of-sample example.\n",

As this stands, the hitter model is incomplete even if the pitcher one is. The difficulties seen in this dataset are relatively expected, however - baseball is known for being a highly quantified sport, especially with the recent success of sabermetric-based teams like the Astros (and Billy Beane's Moneyball, the original spark of interest for baseball statistics to me), and more data will increase complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you to Kaggle, Sean Lahman and his dataset for providing this wealth of information. Future analysis could be to extend the prediction period, scale performance by season to avoid penalizing players with fewer seasons of experience (especially in forward-looking predictions), finite classes within the pitcher/batter categories, and reduction of the training timeframe to have a more modern BBWAA's voting used."
